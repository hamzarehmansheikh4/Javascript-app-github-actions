# Deploy-React.Js-App-Using-GithubActions-On-AWS

I deployed a React.js application on AWS using GitHub Actions for a seamless CI/CD workflow. By setting up GitHub Actions, I automated the build, test, and deployment process, ensuring that every code change is automatically deployed to AWS. This setup enhances collaboration and productivity by enabling continuous deployment with minimal manual intervention. The result is a robust, scalable React.js application with automated deployments, ensuring fast delivery and high availability.
